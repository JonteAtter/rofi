<!-- Structure and most comments are from the Strengthening the reporting of 
observational studies in epidemiology (STROBE) statement, 
see https://www.strobe-statement.org/ -->

<!-- Indicate the study’s design with a commonly used term in the title, for 
example: "Associations between resuscitation interventions and opportunities for 
improvement in adult trauma patients: A cohort study" -->

# Abstract
<!-- Provide in the abstract an informative and balanced summary of what was 
done and what was found. Not more than 300 words. -->

## Background

## Methods

## Results

## Conclusion

# Introduction

<!-- Explain the scientific background and rationale for the investigation being 
reported. End by stating the aim or specific objectives, including any 
prespecified hypotheses. The introduction should not be longer than 1-1.5 pages, 
typically 4-5 paragraphs, each 6-8 lines long. Support every statement with a 
citation -->

# Methods 

## Study design
<!-- Present key elements of study design -->

## Setting
<!-- Describe the setting, locations, and relevant dates, including periods of 
recruitment, exposure, follow-up, and data collection -->

## Participants
<!-- Cohort study: Give the eligibility criteria, and the sources and methods of 
selection of participants. Describe methods of follow-up. For matched studies, 
give matching criteria and number of exposed and unexposed -->

<!-- Case-control study: Give the eligibility criteria, and the sources and +
methods of case ascertainment and control selection. Give the rationale for the 
choice of cases and controls. For matched studies, give matching criteria and 
the number of controls per case -->

<!-- Cross-sectional study: Give the eligibility criteria, and the sources and 
methods of selection of participants -->

## Variables and data sources/measurements
<!-- Clearly define all outcomes, exposures, predictors, potential confounders, 
and effect modifiers. Give diagnostic criteria, if applicable. For each variable 
of interest, give sources of data and details of methods of assessment 
(measurement). Describe comparability of assessment methods if there 
is more than one group  -->

## Bias 
<!-- Describe any efforts to address potential sources of bias -->

## Study size 
<!-- Explain how the study size was arrived at -->

## Quantitative variables
<!-- Explain how quantitative variables were handled in the analyses. If applicable, 
describe which groupings were chosen and why -->

## Statistical methods
<!-- 
(a) Describe all statistical methods, including those used to control for confounding 
(b) Describe any methods used to examine subgroups and interactions 
(c) Explain how missing data were addressed 
(d) Cohort study: If applicable, explain how loss to follow-up was addressed 
Case-control study—If applicable, explain how matching of cases and controls was 
addressed 
Cross-sectional study: If applicable, describe analytical methods taking account 
of sampling strategy 
(e) Describe any sensitivity analyses

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
